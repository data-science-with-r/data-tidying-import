# Workflow

## A new R workflow

::: incremental
-   When working in a Quarto document, your analysis is re-run each time you render

-   If web scraping in a Quarto document, you'd be re-scraping the data each time you knit, which is undesirable (and not *nice*)!

-   An alternative workflow:

    -   Use an R script to save your code
    -   Saving interim data scraped using the code in the script as CSV or RDS files
    -   Use the saved data in your analysis in your Quarto document
