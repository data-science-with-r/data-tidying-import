Hello, and welcome! My name is Mine Ã‡etinkaya-Rundel, and I will be your instructor for the specialization titled Data Science with R. This is the second course in the series -- Data Tidying and Importing.

>>> In the first course we introduced the data science cycle with this figure from the book R for Data Science.

>>> In this course we're going to continue our foray into data transformation, formally introduce data tidying, which often involves reshaping and joining data, and then

>>> Take one more step back and learn to import datasets and discuss many of the considerations and challenges for getting data into R. We'll start with rectangular data, like CSV files and Excel spreadsheets, and then venture on to getting unstructured data off the web with web scraping.

>>> So, given that this is Course 2 in the specialization, what should you know if you haven't (or even if you have) taken Course 1 - data visualization and transformation

>>> Let's start with the toolkit -- coming in to this course you should have basic familiarity with R and RStudio and with writing simple reproducible documents with Quarto. Additionally, you should have some experience with visualizing and transforming data with tools from the tidyverse, primarily ggplot2 and dplyr.

>>> The tidyverse is vast though, and can be used to tackle many data science tasks, some well beyond this course. So, for now, as long as you know that most tidyverse functions take a data frame as their first argument, that data transformation can be done in data pipelines with dplyr, and data visualizations can be built layer-by-layer with ggplot2, you should be good to go. And if you need an introduction or a refresher for any of these, take Course 1 or complete the recommended readings before jumping in.

>>> And if you're ready, or just thinking "bring it on!", let's dive in!
