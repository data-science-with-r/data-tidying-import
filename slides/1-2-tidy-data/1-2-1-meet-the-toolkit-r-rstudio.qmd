# Learning goals

## By the end of the course, you will be able to…

::: incremental
-   gain insights from data

-   gain insights from data, **using modern programming tools and techniques**

-   gain insights from data, using modern programming tools and techniques, **reproducibly with literate programming**

-   gain insights from data, using modern programming tools and techniques, reproducibly with literate programming **and version control**

# R and RStudio

## ![](images/r-logo.png){width="194"}

::: incremental
-   Open-source statistical **programming language**
-   Also an environment for statistical computing and graphics
:::

## ![](images/rstudio-logo.png){fig-align="center" width="427"}

::: incremental
-   Convenient interface for R called an **IDE** (integrated development environment), e.g. *"I write R code in the RStudio IDE"*
-   Not a requirement for programming with R, but it's very commonly used by R programmers and data scientists

## R packages

::: incremental
-   **Packages** are the fundamental units of reproducible R code – they include reusable R functions, documentation of these functions, and sample data

-   Packages are how the community extends R

-   As of April 2024, there are over 20,000 R packages available on **CRAN** (the Comprehensive R Archive Network)

-   We're going to work with a small (but important) subset of these!

## Tour recap: R and RStudio

<br>

## A short list (for now) of R essentials

-   Functions are (most often) verbs, followed by what they will be applied to in parentheses:

```{r}
#| eval: false
do_this(to_this)
do_that(to_this, to_that, with_those)
```

. . .

-   Packages are installed with the `install.packages()` function and loaded with the `library` function, once per session:

```{r}
#| eval: false
install.packages("package_name")
library(package_name)
```

## R essentials (continued)

-   Columns (variables) in data frames are accessed with `$`:

```{r}
#| eval: false
dataframe$var_name
```

. . .

-   Object documentation can be accessed with `?`

```{r}
#| eval: false
?mean
```

## tidyverse

::: columns
::: {.column width="40%"}

::: {.column width="40%"}
::: large
[tidyverse.org](https://www.tidyverse.org/)
:::

::: incremental
-   The **tidyverse** is an opinionated collection of R packages designed for data science

-   All packages share an underlying philosophy and a common grammar
